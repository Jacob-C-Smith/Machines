DFA program. Takes in a series of nodes as a string and allows for the setting of transitions between given nodes and creates a map. Functionality also allows for swapping of transitions between one another for any node. 

## Reflection
### Jon:
I enjoyed this project and working with Jacob. To avoid merge conflicts, we decided to only work from one machine (Jacob's) and to only work on the project when we could meet in person. As such, all the pushes are from his machine on the github repo associated with this project. That being said, we wroked really well together in bouncing ideas and understandings back and forth between eachother. We both made sure that the other was understanding both the concepts and the code as we progressed.
